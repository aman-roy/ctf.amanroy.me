Problem link - [picoCTF: get aHEAD](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/132)

## [Solution](#solution)

Here is the problem hosted at - [http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/)


Here is the important bit from the source code -
```html
...
...
<form action="index.php" method="GET">
	<input type="submit" value="Choose Red"/>
</form>
...
...
<form action="index.php" method="POST">
	<input type="submit" value="Choose Blue"/>
</form>
...
...
```

The color of the page depends on what HTTP method, e.g. `GET` or `POST`, is requested.

There is a hint hidden inside the name of this CTF itself. After trying multiple HTTP methods, `HEAD` has the way to the flag.

Here is the curl command - 
```shell
curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916
```

Output:
```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_70bc61c4}
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```


## [Flag](#flag)

Here is the flag - 
```
picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_70bc61c4}
```
